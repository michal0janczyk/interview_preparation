"""
    The heap is one maximally efficient implementation of an abstract data type called a priority queue,
    and in fact priority queues are often referred to as "heaps", regardless of how they may be implemented.
    A common implementation of a heap is the binary heap, in which the tree is a complete binary tree (see figure).
    Heaps are also crucial in several efficient graph algorithms such as Dijkstra's algorithm. In a heap, the highest (or lowest) priority element is always stored at the root.
    A heap is not a sorted structure and can be regarded as partially ordered.
    As visible from the heap-diagram, there is no particular relationship among nodes on any given level, even among the siblings.
    When a heap is a complete binary tree, it has a smallest possible heightâ€”a heap with N nodes always has log N height.
    A heap is a useful data structure when you need to remove the object with the highest (or lowest) priority.
